# CO2-Forecast-SDG13

**Project:** Forecasting CO₂ emissions per country using supervised learning (Random Forest baseline).

## Overview
We forecast next-year CO₂ emissions using historical emissions, GDP per capita, population, and energy use. The model helps identify countries at risk of emissions growth and supports targeted climate policies.

## Ethical considerations
- Data quality varies across countries; model uncertainty is flagged for low-quality data.
- Use model outputs only to inform — not to dictate — policy.
