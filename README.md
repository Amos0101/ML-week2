# CO2-Forecast-SDG13

**Project:** Forecasting CO₂ emissions per country using supervised learning (Random Forest baseline).

## Overview
We forecast next-year CO₂ emissions using historical emissions, GDP per capita, population, and energy use. The model helps identify countries at risk of emissions growth and supports targeted climate policies.

## Folder structure
(see repo structure in assignment)

## How to run
1. Clone repo
2. Put cleaned CSVs in `data/`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open `notebooks/02-modeling.ipynb` in Colab or locally and run cells.

## Results
- Baseline MAE: X.XXX (example)
- RMSE: X.XXX
- MAPE: XX.X%

(Include two screenshots: EDA plots and predicted vs actual plot)

## Ethical considerations
- Data quality varies across countries; model uncertainty is flagged for low-quality data.
- Use model outputs only to inform — not to dictate — policy.
